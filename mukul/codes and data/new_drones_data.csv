Summary: The pilot of C25B was inbound to SDL for VA to Ry21 from the South. The Biltmore controller vectored the aircraft from over the top of PHX toward a left DW for Ry 21 at 050. After the field was reported in sight, the controller issued a visual approach clearance. When the aircraft descended through 047 on a NE bound DW heading, the pilot reported a ""helicopter, you know, one of those gyro-type things"" that just passed by the windscreen. I had the SDL ATCT give the pilot my phone number so I could clarify. When the pilot called, they used the term NMAC, saying the craft passed from right to left off the nose of the aircraft. The pilot stated they had no time to input any control instructions into the aircraft, but had it been 2 seconds earlier, they would have hit it. The desctription of the aircraft was a small UAV with 4 sets of rotars and a string of all red lights across the whole craft. The pilot estimated the distance from the UAV to his aircraft at between 50-75ft.

Phoenix TRACON (P50) – Thursday, April 16, 2015 at 4:15 p.m. PDT:  C25B was inbound to Scottsdale (SDL) Airport from the south on a Visual Approach to Runway 21.  The pilot reported that as he entered the downwind descending through 4,700 feet a UAS passed across his windshield.  When the pilot called the facility (SDL ATCT) he said that the UAS passed off the nose of the aircraft from left to right and that he had no time to react.  The pilot stated that had it occurred two seconds earlier they would have hit the UAS.  The UAS was described as small with four rotors and a string of red lights across the whole aircraft.  The pilot described the incident as a NMAC and estimated the closest proximity was between 50 and 75 feet.  ",2015,201504,2015-04-16,201516,NA

Review of radar data was conducted to with geography maps on to help determine the location as accurately as possible. During review of the radar data there were no unidentified targets observed in the reported area of the incident. Pilot inspected aircraft after landing at CNO. Aircraft had sustained two gouges to the lower portion of the nose cowl about 3 inches long and deep enough to take off the first layer of fiberglass. Evidence of impact with the inside of two of the three props was evident. There was no blood found anywhere on the aircraft as would have been expected with a bird strike.

2015-04-28 00:00:00,Winchester,Virginia,"On 4/28/15 we had an unmanned aircraft system (quad copter) flying over the carnival (attendance approx. 2,000) which was apparently taking video/pictures of the event. Our officers spoke to the operator. Citizen was cooperative and stopped flying the UAS. Pictures that the UAS were posted on the Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival's (SABF) Facebook page the following morning. I spoke with SABF officials who advised that citizen had a business that does photography and marketing. Citizen tried to work out a deal with SABF to be contracted to take pictures with his UAS for the festival, but no formal agreement was made. Examples of his pictures have been posted on his website. Last fall the Winchester Public Schools used a UAS to assist with making a sort of public service announcement and I believe same cirtizen was also used for that filming. During a planning meeting held by the WPS superintendent I advised  that I believed that the person operating the UAS needed an FAA permit and the response I received was ""he does this all the time."" Citizen was not at this meeting to hear my concern. Please keep in mind that our only encounter with citizen so far has been cooperative. I don't want to appear that we have some issue with him.

West Tower FLM contacted ROC, which disapproved the request. OM also spoke with FLM and disapproved the request. During the conversation with FLM, the UAS operator was told he could not fly the UAS within the Class Bravo. He said he would have to find a work around. On the Saturday evening news footage of a UAS over FM 2499 and the Grapevine spillway  aired during the broadcast. The area filmed is within 5 miles of DFW ATCT. A Youtube video is also online showing the flooding over FM2499 posted by KNR Media.",2015,201506,2015-06-20,201525,LEO NOT NOTIFIED

We then got a call from a pilot who called to complain that someone from ""Owego tower"" called on frequency 122.8 and reported they have lost control of a drone and to watch out. The pilot actually saw the drone. According to our COA regarding the use of their drones, they executed every requirement of the COA when they lost the plane. A NOTAM was issued for UAS activity prior to departure, they called to report the loss of contact and they got on CZG frequency to provide notification to any pilots in the area as a warning. They indicated they did not recover the drone but based on the time lapse, it would have run out of fuel by now and is down somewhere.

On July 25, 2015, COOK CHILDREN HOSPITAL pilot tried to call attention to the drone operator from the top of the west side of the parking garage overlooking Thistle Hill. The drone operator ignored his requests, turned his back and looked down at his screen. At this time the drone flew from the east side of Thistle Hill to about over the Thistle Hill sidewalk and elevation varied from about 50' to 100 feet above the elevated west helipad at Cook Childrens. This prevented us from taking off and getting back in to service and taking our next call. This also could have been much worse had we arrived and hour later and arrived when the drone was flying as we may not have seen the drone upon landing at Cook Childrens Medical Center perhaps creating an in air collision with the drone. Had we not seen the drone prior to take off the same situation could have occurred creating an in air collision with the drone as our usual departure is to the west. The security officer at Cook Children could see from the elevator that we were having some sort of issue. Normally the pilot does not leave raised helipad area to yell and wave arms over the side of the parking garage. She came over to assist and she could not get the drone operators attention either. She used her radio to have another officer drive over to tell the drone operator to land. I requested that she ask the officer to get his identification. The operator refused to produce any identification citing he does this for a living and he was hired by the historical society to take pictures of Thistle Hill. He is more than 5 miles from and airport and under 400 feet. He is well within his rights and does not have to show any one anything. The security officer on the ground got pictures of the respective vehicles the operator of the drone and historical society persons left in.

For this event, law enforcement had not been notified.

Summary: RECEIVED CALL FROM COAST GUARD PILOT REPORTING HE WITNESSED DRONE OPERATIONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MOB AIRPORT WHILE DRIVING IN HIS VEHICLE. OPERATION WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE PALMERS TOYOTA PARKING LOT WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY MOB145001. UNDER THE RWY33 FINAL. CONTACTED AIRPORT POLICE AND THE AIRPORT MANAGER AND THEY WENT TO INVESTIGATE. Following is the email: We spoke with the GM at Palmers Toyota regarding the drone operation earlier today. He said they were filming a commercial, but would not give up the companys name who was hired to shoot the film, or the drone operator. While on-site we spoke with the person who first reported the drone operation and he provided us with a great deal of information for the FAA investigation. He said he spoke with the film crew, and told them they could not fly unmanned aircraft in such close proximity to the airport. He is in the Coast Guard at ATC Mobile and is very familiar with the layout of MOB and its arrival/departure corridors. He also mentioned that he was told the drone operators were wearing -Tower Drone- shirts. A quick Google search shows the company being based out of PNS. It does not appear that the company has a Section 333 exemption for commercial drone operations. ",2015,201508,2015-08-05,201532,MOBILE AIRPORT PD NOTIFIED

Summary: Upon landing and turning off the runway, RPA4674 reported having seen a light over the field, moving northeastbound. At the same time the two of us saw the object, which we could only identify as an orange light. The aircraft estimated it was approximately 100' AGL and said it looked to be a drone. Several minutes later we saw it again south of the field heading northeastbound. I was not able to get a much better look at it, but it did appear to have a two lights and appeared to be moving fairly quickly. We again lost sight of it once it was northeast of the field. Local police and DEN notified.
