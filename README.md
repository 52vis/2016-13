# 52 Vis - 2016 Week 13

FAA UAS data set featured in Data Is Plural and blogged: <a href="https://rud.is/b/2016/03/30/introducing-a-weekly-r-python-js-etc-vis-challenge/">here</a>.

You can find the data files at <http://www.faa.gov/uas/law_enforcement/uas_sighting_reports/>.

My example R code is [here](https://github.com/52vis/2016-13/blob/master/2016-13.r) and here's my sample vis:

Feel free to do a PR to the repo for your creation. Just make a directory and put your code in there with a sample vis or a screenshot (you may have an interactive vis which requires a run-time environment).
